HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE ========================== Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC.
Guido remains Python's principal author although it includes many contributions from others.
In 1995 Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us) in Reston Virginia where he released several versions of the software.
In May 2000 Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.
In October of the same year the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations which became Zope Corporation.
In 2001 the Python Software Foundation (PSF see https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.
All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for the Open Source Definition).
Historically most but not all Python releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.
Release     Derived   Year    Owner    GPL- from                compatible?

All Python licenses unlike the GPL let you distribute a modified version without making your changes open source.
The GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
(2) According to Richard Stallman 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible because its license has a choice of law clause.
According to CNRI however Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1 is not incompatible with the GPL.
Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's direction to make these releases possible.

Libgfortran is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 3 or (at your option) any later version.
Libgfortran is distributed in the hope that it will be useful but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
See the GNU General Public License for more details.
Under Section 7 of GPL version 3 you are granted additional permissions described in the GCC Runtime Library Exception version 3.1 as published by the Free Software Foundation.
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License and a copy of the GCC Runtime Library Exception along with this program; see the files COPYING3 and COPYING.RUNTIME respectively.
If not see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
---- Full text of license texts referred to above follows (that they are listed below does not necessarily imply the conditions apply to the present binary release): ---- GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION Version 3.1 31 March 2009 Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation Inc.
<http://fsf.org/> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed.
This GCC Runtime Library Exception (Exception) is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3).
It applies to a given file (the Runtime Library) that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.
When you use GCC to compile a program GCC may combine portions of certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled program.
The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use in this way the header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.
0. Definitions.
A file is an Independent Module if it either requires the Runtime Library for execution after a Compilation Process or makes use of an interface provided by the Runtime Library but is not otherwise based on the Runtime Library.
GCC means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection with or without modifications governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any subsequent versions published by the FSF.
GPL-compatible Software is software whose conditions of propagation modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with the license of GCC.
Target Code refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual target processor architecture in executable form or suitable for input to an assembler loader linker and/or execution phase.
Notwithstanding that Target Code does not include data in any format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation or used for producing a compiler intermediate representation.
The Compilation Process transforms code entirely represented in non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code and/or in Java Virtual Machine byte code into Target Code.
Thus for example use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered part of the Compilation Process since the Compilation Process can be understood as starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors.
A Compilation Process is Eligible if it is done using GCC alone or with other GPL-compatible software or if it is done without using any work based on GCC.
For example using non-GPL-compatible Software to optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an Eligible Compilation Process.
1. Grant of Additional Permission.
You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules even if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3 provided that all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes.
You may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.
2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.
The availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the license of GCC.
---- GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3 29 June 2007 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation Inc.
<http://fsf.org/> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed.
Preamble The GNU General Public License is a free copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.
By contrast the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.
We the Free Software Foundation use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.
You can apply it to your programs too.
When we speak of free software we are referring to freedom not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish) that you receive source code or can get it if you want it that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs and that you know you can do these things.
To protect your rights we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.
Therefore you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
For example if you distribute copies of such a program whether gratis or for a fee you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received.
You must make sure that they too receive or can get the source code.
And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy distribute and/or modify it.
For the developers' and authors' protection the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software.
For both users' and authors' sake the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them although the manufacturer can do so.
This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.
The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.
Therefore we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products.
If such problems arise substantially in other domains we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL as needed to protect the freedom of users.
Finally every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers but in those that do we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary.
To prevent this the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
The precise terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification follow.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Definitions.
This License refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
Copyright also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works such as semiconductor masks.
The Program refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
Each licensee is addressed as you.
Licensees and recipients may be individuals or organizations.
To modify a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission other than the making of an exact copy.
The resulting work is called a modified version of the earlier work or a work based on the earlier work.
A covered work means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.
To propagate a work means to do anything with it that without permission would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.
Propagation includes copying distribution (with or without modification) making available to the public and in some countries other activities as well.
To convey a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.
Mere interaction with a user through a computer network with no transfer of a copy is not conveying.
An interactive user interface displays Appropriate Legal Notices to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided) that licensees may convey the work under this License and how to view a copy of this License.
If the interface presents a list of user commands or options such as a menu a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
1. Source Code.
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.
Object code means any non-source form of a work.
A Standard Interface means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body or in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language one that is widely used among developers working in that language.
The System Libraries of an executable work include anything other than the work as a whole that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component but which is not part of that Major Component and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.
A Major Component in this context means a major essential component (kernel window system and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs or a compiler used to produce the work or an object code interpreter used to run it.
The Corresponding Source for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate install and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work including scripts to control those activities.
However it does not include the work's System Libraries or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.
For example Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work. 2.
Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program.
The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output given its content constitutes a covered work.
This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent as provided by copyright law.
You may make run and propagate covered works that you do not convey without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you or provide you with facilities for running those works provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.
Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf under your direction and control on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below.
Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. 3.
Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996 or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.
When you convey a covered work you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing against the work's users your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.
4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program or the modifications to produce it from the Program in the form of source code under the terms of section 4 provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it and giving a relevant date.
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7.
This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to keep intact all notices.
c) You must license the entire work as a whole under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.
This License will therefore apply along with any applicable section 7 additional terms to the whole of the work and all its parts regardless of how they are packaged.
This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices your work need not make them do so.
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium is called an aggregate if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.
6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5 provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License in one of these ways: a) Convey the object code in or embodied in a physical product (including a physical distribution medium) accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
b) Convey the object code in or embodied in a physical product (including a physical distribution medium) accompanied by a written offer valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.
This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially and only if you received the object code with such an offer in accord with subsection 6b.
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge) and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge.
You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.
If the place to copy the object code is a network server the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.
A separable portion of the object code whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library need not be included in conveying the object code work.
A User Product is either (1) a consumer product which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal family or household purposes or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.
In determining whether a product is a consumer product doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.
For a particular product received by a particular user normally used refers to a typical or common use of that class of product regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses or expects or is expected to use the product.
A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial industrial or non-consumer uses unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.
Installation Information for a User Product means any methods procedures authorization keys or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.
The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.
If you convey an object code work under this section in or with or specifically for use in a User Product and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized) the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.
But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example the work has been installed in ROM).
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service warranty or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.
Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.
Corresponding Source conveyed and Installation Information provided in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form) and must require no special password or key for unpacking reading or copying.
7. Additional Terms.
Additional permissions are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.
If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program that part may be used separately under those permissions but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.
When you convey a copy of a covered work you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy or from any part of it.
(Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material added by you to a covered work for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License for material you add to a covered work you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names trademarks or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered further restrictions within the meaning of section 10.
If the Program as you received it or any part of it contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction you may remove that term.
If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section you must place in the relevant source files a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.
Additional terms permissive or non-permissive may be stated in the form of a separately written license or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.
8. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.
Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).
However if you cease all violation of this License then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license and (b) permanently if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
Moreover your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.
If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.
9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.
Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.
However nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work.
These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.
Therefore by modifying or propagating a covered work you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors to run modify and propagate that work subject to this License.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
